# TensorFlow_Complete_Guide
This is a Complete guide for all the major concpets in TensorFlow framework for Deeplearning.
**TensorFlow** is a popular framework of machine learning and deep learning. It is a free and open source library which is developed by **Google Brain Team**. It is entirely bassed on Python programming languagee and use for numerical computation and data flow, which makes machine learning faster and easier.

Deep learning techniques are based on neural networks, sometimes referred to as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), which are a subset of machine learning. Their structure and nomenclature are modelled after the human brain, mirroring the communication between organic neurons.

Node layers, which include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, make up artificial neural networks. Each artificial neuron, or node, is connected to another and has a weight and threshold that go with it. Any node whose output exceeds the defined threshold value is activated and begins providing data to the network's uppermost layer. Otherwise, no data is sent to the network's next tier.

A **Neural Network for Regression** is a type of artificial neural network used to predict conotinuous values, such as prices or weights. Regression neural networks are similar to other ANNs, but optimized to predict values within a range, rather than classifying data into categories.

<h3>Neural Network for Classification</h3>
Classification problem involves predicting if something belongs to one class or not. In other words, while doing it we try to see something is one thing or another.

**Types of Classification**<br>
Suppose that you want to predict if a person has diabetes or not. İf you are facing this kind of situation, there are two possibilities. That is called **Binary Classification**.

Suppose that you want to identify if a photo is of a toy, a person, or a cat, right? this is called **Multi-class Classification** because there are more than two options.

Suppose you want to decide that which categories should be assigned to an article. If so, it is called **Multi-label Classification**, because one article could have more than one category assigned.

<h3>Computer Vision</h3>

Computer vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. It uses digital images, videos and other visual inputs to derive meaningful information and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

<h3>Transfer Learning</h3>

Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second related task. Instead of training a model from scratch for the second task, you start with a pre-trained model that has already learned useful features or representations from a large dataset and then fine-tune it on new task.
